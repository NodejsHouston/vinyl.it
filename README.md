# Vinyl.it
------
This Node.js Houston project will serve as an academic playground for exploring the advantages of node.js in the world of mobile web apps. Utilizing a robust pre-existing API and database (discogs.com) we are afforded a solid foundation to build our solutions to the problems with blurring the lines between native and web apps… oh and it’s gonna be cool.
